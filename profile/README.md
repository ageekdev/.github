### ‚ú® New Packages

#### Suggesting a new package
Have a suggestion or working on a new package? Please create a new issue for that package.

#### I'm working on a new package
Please create an issue for it if it does not already exist, then PR you code for review.

#### Workflow for new package
1) Obtain a fresh copy of [skeleton repo](https://github.com/ageekdev/skeleton) by downloading the ZIP file. This ensures your package has a clean commit history without placeholders. 
2) Next, use find and replace to update all placeholders like the package name, author, and email with the proper values. 
3) Develop the core logic for your package and write tests to validate it works as expected. 
4) Fork this repository, configure it as a remote, and push your package code to a new branch. 
5) Submit a new PR against this repo for review.
